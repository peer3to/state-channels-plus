# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the `state-channels-plus` project! While this repository is open-source, contributions are primarily made by our internal team. To maintain code quality and streamline collaboration, please adhere to the following guidelines.

---

## 📦 Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### ✅ Scope and Size

- **Single Purpose**: Each PR should address a single issue or feature. Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes.
- **Manageable Size**: Aim to keep PRs under 1000 lines of code. Larger PRs can be challenging to review and may delay the integration process.

### 📝 Draft Pull Requests

- **Purposeful Drafts**: Use draft PRs to seek specific feedback or pose clear questions. Do not use drafts as placeholders for incomplete work.
- **Timely Progression**: Convert drafts to ready-for-review status promptly once the implementation is complete and feedback has been addressed.
- **Avoid Stagnation**: Draft PRs should not remain open without updates or interaction. Inactive drafts may be closed to maintain repository hygiene.

### 🧪 Code Quality and Testing

- **Compilation**: Ensure that your code compiles successfully before submitting a PR. Uncompilable code hinders the review process.
- **Testing**: Include relevant tests with your PR to validate new functionality or changes. Code accompanied by tests is highly desirable.
- **Self-Review**: Perform a self-review of your code to identify potential issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.

### 📄 Description and Documentation

- **Clear Descriptions**: Provide a concise and informative description of the changes made, including the rationale and any relevant context.
- **Issue Linking**: Reference related issues by including phrases like `Closes #issue-number` to facilitate tracking.
- **Follow-Up**: If the PR leads to additional tasks or considerations, link to or create follow-up issues to ensure continuity.

### 🚀 Readiness for Review

- **Complete Work**: Only mark PRs as ready for review when the implementation is complete, tests are passing, and documentation is updated.
- **Responsiveness**: Be prepared to respond to review comments in a timely manner and make necessary adjustments.
