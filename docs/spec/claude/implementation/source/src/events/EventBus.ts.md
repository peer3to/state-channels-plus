## Responsibility and observable boundary

The internal pub/sub bus carrying committed protocol events (incl. contract logs republished
post-commit) to application consumers.

## Key design decisions

1. **Post-commit publication only** — the bus is fed from success paths, keeping event fidelity.

## Inputs, outputs, state, and side effects

| Aspect       | Contents        |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Inputs       | Per role above. |
| Outputs      | Per role above. |
| Owned state  | Per role above. |
| Side effects | Per role above. |

## Linked requirements

A file may contribute to several requirements; this report describes the contribution and never
claims complete conformance for a requirement that depends on other files.

| Source file                                                | Specification IDs |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [EventBus.ts](../../../../../../../src/events/EventBus.ts) | `REQ-SDK-ARCH-3`  |

## Assumptions, dependencies, trust boundaries, and limits

- Operates inside the participant runtime; untrusted input arrives only through the documented ingress paths.

## Specification adherence

- Role-consistent with the owning views.

## Specification contradictions

None demonstrated.

## Missing behavior

None demonstrated.

## Conformance traceability

Status enum: `Covered` | `Partial` | `Contradicts` | `Missing`. Evidence cells are structured
**Here:** / **Other files:** so each row is auditable from its links alone; genuine gaps go in the
Gap column. Audit state is file-level (Status header), never a row status.

| Requirement / invariant | Implementation status | Evidence | Gap / divergence |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |

## Component test obligations

Exact test evidence is mapped against these IDs in the verification test reports.

| Unit test ID | Obligation | Public entry and setup | Oracle and forbidden effects | Required permutations |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
