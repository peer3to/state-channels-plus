## Responsibility and observable boundary

The chain-time tracker: the node's protocol clock derived from observed block timestamps, serving
`getTimeInSeconds`/`getBlockchainTime` to every window computation.

## Key design decisions

1. **Local wall time is never protocol time** — consumers read the chain-derived clock ([`REQ-TIME-1`](../../../specification/protocol-model/time.md#req-time-1)).

## Inputs, outputs, state, and side effects

| Aspect       | Contents        |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Inputs       | Per role above. |
| Outputs      | Per role above. |
| Owned state  | Per role above. |
| Side effects | Per role above. |

## Linked requirements

A file may contribute to several requirements; this report describes the contribution and never
claims complete conformance for a requirement that depends on other files.

| Source file                                | Specification IDs                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Clock.ts](../../../../../../src/Clock.ts) | [`REQ-TIME-1`](../../../specification/protocol-model/time.md#req-time-1) |

## Assumptions, dependencies, trust boundaries, and limits

- Operates inside the participant runtime; untrusted input arrives only through the documented ingress paths.

## Specification adherence

- Role-consistent with the owning views; no divergence observed at this file's boundary.

## Specification contradictions

None demonstrated.

## Missing behavior

None demonstrated.

## Conformance traceability

Status enum: `Covered` | `Partial` | `Contradicts` | `Missing`. Evidence cells are structured
**Here:** / **Other files:** so each row is auditable from its links alone; genuine gaps go in the
Gap column. Audit state is file-level (Status header), never a row status.

| Requirement / invariant | Implementation status | Evidence | Gap / divergence |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |

## Component test obligations

Exact test evidence is mapped against these IDs in the verification test reports.

| Unit test ID | Obligation | Public entry and setup | Oracle and forbidden effects | Required permutations |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
