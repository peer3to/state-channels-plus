# Specification Assessment

> **Agent assessment:** In progress.
> **Engineer disposition:** Pending.

The migrated protocol documents retain the reconstructed requirements, but their neutral templates and
interoperability cases are not yet complete. The generated specification index is the current queue.

The peer-communication layer now separates the handshake contract from post-authentication
engagement. The handshake specification ends at an authenticated identity-bound session and states
the objective boundary explicitly: mutual key proof, bidirectional inclusive clock compatibility
with an independent exchange-freshness bound, objective-facts-only separation, and the current
uniform-continued-interaction baseline; a future subjective engagement policy is an open question,
not interim behavior. The local-lifecycle engagement and catch-up contract is owned by the
synchronization specification. Fallback policy now covers both the SDK ban handle and final
authenticated admission: healthy direct transport and explicit exclusion refuse late bootstrap
connections, while current-direct retirement permits fallback. Authenticated-RPC guard work is
scoped to its transport and owner lifetime, and a late frame after local transport close is dropped
without peer punishment. Bounded relay retry cancellation and byte-exact
discovery topic leave semantics are unchanged. Each behavior has an
explicit black-box plan and permutation set; the newly added clock-boundary, separation, baseline,
and opened-non-participant permutations are planned but not yet covered by executable evidence;
engineer disposition remains pending.
