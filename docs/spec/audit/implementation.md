# Implementation Assessment

> **Agent assessment:** In progress.
> **Engineer disposition:** Pending.

Join admission now keeps recorded membership separate from countersign eligibility: snapshot and
pending participants remain members, on-chain-slashed members lose veto power, and slashed members
cannot top up. The public paths preserve exact fork/snapshot pins and deadline semantics and invoke
the manager's atomic composable-deposit path; the manager, not the facet, owns the inbound JOIN
append and cumulative-total update.

Off-chain join authorization uses the same slash-excluding threshold set on collector and
responder paths. The collector now rejects a deadline with no positive collection window before
it signs or sends requests; positive windows cap every request at the earlier of the agreement
timeout and the join deadline. The responder keeps the inclusive deadline boundary used by
on-chain submission.

Snapshot submission now has explicit component obligations for admissible submission, unresolved
reduction stand-down, unconsumed-inbound preparation refusal, and no on-chain mutation after that
refusal. Forced-inclusion verification follows the pending JOIN through reduction into the
successor participant set and through one complete leader-election cycle where the joiner authors
an accepted block.

The runtime lifecycle waits for the application root's readiness hook before admission and preserves readiness failures while disposing partial resources. Each isolated context starts monitoring after its own ready work and uses the same configured fatal-delay threshold. The test harness starts its main-thread monitor after initial peer setup.

Runtime extension boundaries no longer depend on constructor identity for RPC services, transports, or ethers Result values. They validate the complete public shape consumed by the caller, so compatible SDK and ethers copies can coexist in one production bundle without breaking proxy resolution, dispatch overloads, or result normalization. The linked source reports and runtime design views record these boundaries; engineer review remains pending.

Inbound RPC endpoint authorization is separate from those structural checks. The dispatcher walks the
application methods hierarchy only up to `ARpcMethods.prototype`, accepts function-valued data properties,
rejects base members and accessors, and invokes the captured function on both delivery paths. This resolves
[`DEF-7-PK564B`](open-findings.md#def-7-pk564b) without breaking inherited application endpoint families.

RPC wire parsing, ingress ordering, guards, and every implemented request-settlement path now have
exact component obligations and evidence. Request settlement remains partial because there is no
cancellation API. Resource control remains partial: the frame-size bound exists, but pending-call,
per-peer, and aggregate work limits do not. Protocol compatibility remains missing because neither
the envelope nor handshake negotiates a version. [`DEF-8-HWJ10N`](open-findings.md#def-8-hwj10n)
is resolved: handler and guard response sends use one guarded attempt, then disconnect on failure
without a second send or unhandled rejection.

The runtime event bridge also preserves application-defined hook names and cloneable payloads without adding
those names to the SDK hook declaration. The EventBus source report and real worker-to-client test now own
that extension contract.

The canonical codec now exposes typed decode overloads for every mapped protocol and proof schema,
including the previously omitted inbound-hash dispute proof. Its source report covers the full enum,
EVM-result, Result-normalization, cache, and failure surface.

The ethers Result proxy now keeps callback-wrapper identity after one listener removal, so repeated
registrations can also be removed repeatedly through the original callback. Its source report now
records the complete method, listener, event-log, query, and passthrough boundary instead of only
the structural Result predicate.

Other specification-mirrored implementation subjects, exhaustive source inventories, conformance decisions, and unit variants remain visible in generated coverage.
