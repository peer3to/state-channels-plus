# Peer3 - State Channels Plus

This is an SDK for creating highly scalable and resilient client side peer-to-peer (p2p) state channels for arbitrary state machines with shared security inherited from a distributed ledger (blockchain).

The repository currently holds a Minimal Feature Set (MFS) as part of our [grant agreement](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2350) with the Web3 Foundation.

We recommend waiting for the Full Feature Set before using it in production.
